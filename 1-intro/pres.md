## Distribution? Serverless?

   - **Distribution**: a collection of software:
     - integrated and ready to run
     - it generally comes with supportes from the vendors

   - **Serverless**: coding in the cloud without *managing* servers
      - the idea: push your code to the cloud and run it
      - no server management involved!
        - the dream of every developer...

  ## OpenWhisk? Kubernetes?

   - **Apache OpenWhisk**: a open source project 
     - used by IBM, Digital Ocean, Adobe and others 
     - implements a serverless environment 

   - **Kubernetes**: the de-facto Cloud Operating System
      - think to it as a version of Linux adapted to the cloud
      - it is available everywhere, like Linux
